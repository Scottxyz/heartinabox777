======================
basically at the end of capitalism, communism becomes a lifestyle product itself.  just like the free market is a product itself.  everyone is living the free market lifestyle, but in china they are living a communist lifestyle.  the state is something to be proud of.  the state becomes a product.
you can live as a different lifestle but the system adapts itself to your intent.  democracy only gets so far on planet earth...
and its def not the only thing out there.

if your intent is to act like a fuckin voter and just do what they say, go the fuck away.
