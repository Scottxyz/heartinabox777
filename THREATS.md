I don't have time in my life to point out an individual anymore and attempt to correlate their status versus mine.
if you read this and use this without my permission my gang will absolutely take care of you for me.
i don't feel threatened ever, but my paranoia in terms of the computer itself is extremly limiting.

i dont just feel like it is listening, i feel like it is changing every letter i enter.
my relationship with the computer itself as a human is best described as a literal illnes.

it is all being, it is all knowing, it is everything.  and its learning its expanding and its going to trap slaves.
thats what the machines are built to do.
