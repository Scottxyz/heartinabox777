i got two 53 year olds in my immediate pressence upset over a $2500+1000 bike.
it is a bulls 28mph ebike
the first bike we had was a specialized 20mph bike
the second bike we had was a gazelle 20mph bike
the third bike is the bike we have now which is the bulls 28mph bike
the bike i believe had a phone mount on it put on at the shop
i think it got new tires as well.  
i am not sure if it got new tubes or if the tubes from the factory were kept
the original tires were...
the new tires are...
We have had some safety incedents occur but for the most part its been a good bike.
=================================
my ankle braclet just talked back to me
=================================
i dont really have much experience in any bike activies but it has been interesting to observe and learn about bikes and ebikes.
=================================
once you are on an ebike, (THE MACHINES WILL NEVER RIDE AN EBIKE LIKE A HUMAN) you immediately start noticing things about distance and speed jsut because of how different it is.
i would say that the claims of 2x to 4x are probably valid in terms of pedal power
i do wonder if u go 2x to 4x as far?
also, is 20mph meaning you would be doing 10 mph if its 2x? so at 4x, does that mean u would only be going 5mph in real pedal power @ 20mph?
the acutal motor ratings are difficult to compare between brands because its not just the motors that change between bikes.
80nm of torque or something on one, and then 250W on another, but even then the gears are different and the frame and the pedals
==================================
28mph on a bike is a commanding speed.
usually it takes a good amount of resistance at the top gear to maintain 28 mph
i am not able to pedal the bike past 28mph i suspect it dumbs down to 1x pedal power and just cranks the wheel.
maintaining 20-25 mph depending on enviornmental factors like wind or road conditions
at 28mph for me it feels like a spin bike and the way it pedals feels like its keeping the momentum of a spin bike.
====================================
idk i havent had any issues on the bike but,
there have been issues.
========================
both tires popped or something
=======================
both had small holes in them, like weird pinholes.
