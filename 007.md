when the sky falls.
it never did, in fact it only got better.

with the sun getting hotter by the minute, i settled down for a nap. as i laid down, i felt like i was to return back to the jungle.

i felt like i was to be there again, practicing my presence.

it wasn't long before i was awakened.

it was so dark, so fast, that i couldn't sleep.

i wondered why i felt so different, yet i kept repeating that if I am i will soon be home.

i got my things and headed back down to the shore.
