my surival depends upon empathy.
to pursue monsters, we must understand them.
we must venture into their minds.
monsters do not get into our brains.
God poked his head down from the sky and crooned a double bass
The creation of the earth is rendered in clay before my eyes
Geese migrate more gracefully than the noble gazelle 
Glassy plastic sand dunes monoliths binary exist/non-exist. 
What binds the whole of the parts is the taste of added value
Legionierre estranges killing the arabs
Life emerges in spirals 
Liquid evacuates my body 
Yet all is dry 
Especialmente en mi boca
